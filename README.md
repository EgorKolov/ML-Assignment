# ML-Assignment
The project contains code of two basic model architectures for image classification and regression and several checkpoints for them. The two .ipynb files are divided in three parts: setup, training (starts with "# Training part" cell) and inference (starts with "# Inference part" cell). Setup part is required to run before both the training and inference steps.

# Prerequisites
In order to run the models, extract the dataset into <project_folder>/data/  
This is what your file structure should look like:
+ data/
  + train/
    + label.csv
    + train (1).png
    + ...
  + test/
    + label.csv
    + test (1).png
    + ...
+ classifier/
  + ...
+ regression/
  + ...
